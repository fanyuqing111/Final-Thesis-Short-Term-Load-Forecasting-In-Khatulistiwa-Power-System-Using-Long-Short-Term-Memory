# Final-Thesis

This is a repository about my final thesis. The title of my final thesis is Short-Term Load Forecasting in Khatulistiwa Power System Using Long-Short-Term Memory Method.
In this final thesis, I implemented four algorithms which are Long Short Term Memory, Artificial Neural Network (MLP), Recurrent Neural Network, and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
to forecast the load demand. These models then compared to the existing algorithms. 

Abstract :
Short term load forecasting plays vital role in electrical system operation. It has function to keep the equilibrium between power demand  consumption and supply. 
This research presents the implementation of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method for short term load forecasting in the West Kalimantan System. LSTM performance
will be compared to Load Coefficient as the existing method used for weekly operation by PLN. There is no significant advantage found between LSTM and Load 
Coefficient. LSTM has average RMSE of 15.046 MW, while Load Coefficient has average RMSE of 15.213 MW. Besides that, this research also compared between LSTM and Recurrent
Neural Network (RNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). LSTM has significant advantage against ANN and ARIMA, but LSTM
has no significant advantage against RNN.
